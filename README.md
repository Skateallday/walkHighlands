# walkHighlands

A React app that filters Scottish Munros based on public transport accessibility, inspired by [walkhighlands.co.uk](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/).

## Motivation

I relied on walkhighlands.co.uk daily but needed a way to filter Munros by public transport. The original site didn’t allow this, so I built this app to solve that problem and make planning hikes easier without a car.

## Built With

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS Modules
- Git / GitHub Pages for deployment

## Features

- Filter Munros by public transport accessibility
- Display routes and relevant data
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Demo

- Filtering and mapping data efficiently
- Deploying a React app via GitHub Pages
